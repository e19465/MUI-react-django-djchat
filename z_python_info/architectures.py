"""
Different architectures
-----------------------

1. Event-Driven  => Reacts to user actions or system changes in real-time. Common in web apps and IoT systems.

2. Layered       => Divides components into horizontal layers for better organization and scalability.

3. Client-Server => Separates clients making requests from servers providing resources or services.

4. Microservices => Comprises small, independent services communicating through APIs. Promotes flexibility    and  scalability.

5. Service-Oriented (SOA) => Decomposes systems into reusable services accessed to fulfill business requirements.

6. Monolithic => Builds applications as a single unit, often simpler initially but harder to maintain and scale over time.
